    "How We Will Measure Success:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Conversion Rate: How many deposit customers end up taking a personal loan.\n",
    "- Customer Segmentation: Identify groups of customers (by age, income, behavior, etc.) who are more likely to accept a loan.\n",
    "- Campaign Efficiency: Improve the conversion rate above the current benchmark of 9%.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###  What Questions Should We Ask?\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve our goal, we can ask these straightforward questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Customer Profile:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What customer details (such as age, income, family size, and education) are related to the acceptance of a personal loan?\n",
    "- What does the \"typical\" customer who accepts a loan look like (for example, average age, income, and credit card spending)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Behavioral Impact:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How does the average monthly credit card spending (CCAvg) affect loan acceptance?\n",
    "- Do customers who already have other banking products (like a securities account, a certificate of deposit account, or online banking) have a higher chance of accepting a loan?\n",
    "\n",
    "Experience and Financial Stability:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How do work experience and age influence the decision to accept a loan?\n",
    "- Does having a mortgage affect the likelihood of a customer accepting a personal loan?\n",
    "\n",
    "Geographical Influence:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Does the location where the customer lives (using postal code or county name) affect whether they accept a loan?\n",
    "\n",
    "Campaign Optimization:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Which factors (or combinations of factors) are best at predicting loan acceptance, and how can we use that information to improve targeted marketing?\n",
    "- How can we segment deposit customers to make personal loan marketing more effective?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###  How Will We Prepare and Analyze the Data?\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Cleaning:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fix missing values (for example, fill in missing ages or incomes with the average, and treat missing values in mortgage or family size as zero).\n",
    "- Remove duplicate records and drop unnecessary columns (such as the customer ID).\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Enrichment:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add useful information, such as merging postal code data with county names to capture geographical nuances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Descriptive Statistics: Find out basic information like averages, medians, and standard deviations for important features, such as age, income, and credit card spending.\n",
    "- Visualizations: Create charts like histograms, box plots, bar charts, and scatter plots to understand data patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Filtering and Comparison:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compare the characteristics of customers who accepted the loan with those who did not, using filters or cross-tabulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Engineering:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Consider creating new data points (for example, combining age and experience or grouping income levels) that might better explain why a customer accepts a loan.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "###  How Will We Share Our Findings?\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualization of Key Insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use simple and clear charts and diagrams (such as bar charts, scatter plots, or violin plots) that can be easily understood by everyone, including non-technical people.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary of the Impact:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Explain in simple terms how the findings help in making decisions. For example, if a certain group of customers is more likely to accept a loan, indicate how this information can guide future marketing strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Provide clear and practical advice. For example, if high-income, middle-aged customers with securities accounts are more likely to accept a loan, suggest that the marketing campaign be specifically directed at that group.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "By clearly defining our goal, deciding how to measure success, asking the right questions, and then cleaning, analyzing, and presenting the data in a simple way, we can turn our findings into real business decisions that will help the bank expand its loan business."
